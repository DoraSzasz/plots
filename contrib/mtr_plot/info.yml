    Explore the impact of Clinton and Trump's tax reform proposals on average marginal tax rates
    facing taxpayers across the income distribution. 
    The included provisions of Clinton's proposal are: (1) Surtax of 4% on AGI over $5mm; 
    (2) 30% of AGI minimum tax; (3) 28% limitation on the value of itemized deductions; 
    (4) Child tax credit expansion for children under 5. 
    The included provisions of Trump's proposal are: (1) Three tax brackets (12%, 25%,
    33%); (2) Change thresholds for QDIV/CG; (3) Repeal AMT and net investment income tax; 
    (4) Change the standard deduction amounts; (5) Repeal
    personal exemptions; (6) Repeal HH status; (7) Cap itemized deductions.
    Clinton's proposals affecting high-income taxpayers are not visible on this plot because
    they directly affect only a tiny sliver of the top one percentile of taxpayers.
